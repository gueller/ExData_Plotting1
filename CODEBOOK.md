# This is the Codebook for the Electic Power Consumption Project

The original data was provided by the professor.  It will be included in my repo.

# Descriptions of the initial nine variables of the dataset

These descriptions were taken from the UCI Web site () and broke down by the professor as follows:

1. Date: Date in date format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: Time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global_active_power: Household global minute-averages active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global_reactive_power: Household global minute averages reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: Minute-averages voltage (in volt)
6. Global_intensity: Household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub_metering_1: Energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy).  It coresponds to the kitchen, containing
   mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. Sub_metering_2: Energy submetering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy).  It coresponds to the laundry room, containing
   a washing-machine, a tumblr-drier a refridgerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: Energy submetering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy).  It coresponds to an electric water-heater and
   an air-conditioner.
